# Ace Token Farming

Yield farming is the practice of staking or lending crypto assets in order to generate high returns or rewards in the form of additional cryptocurrency. I want to build a Dapp that allows users to stake thier crypto assets into the TokenFarm smart contract used on the Dapp and get rewarded with an ERC20 token that I have created and added on the contract. Users can also unstake thier assets as required and take back the rewards, they have recieved for staking.

  1. Login for User
  2. Stake Crypto Assets
  3. Issue ERC20 Token Rewards
  4. Unstake Crypto Assets
